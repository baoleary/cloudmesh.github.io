Development Activities
======================================================================

We are working on a number of devellopment projects. Instead of just providing a single project, we decided to split the development up in some smaller subproject. This allows the groups to work independently from each other and avoids the problem that a compile error in one code causes an issue in another. All projects listed her are managed in github.
